# SmartGrid-GA-Optimization

This project is about improving how electricity is shared across Nepal’s smart grid — which is a modern, technology-based system for managing power throughout the country. It uses a Genetic Algorithm, a technique inspired by nature’s way of evolving solutions, to find the best plan for sending energy from different sources to where it’s needed at every hour.
The goal is to make sure that:

•	Electricity demand in different parts of Nepal is met on time.

•	The overall cost of producing and delivering power is as low as possible.

•	Energy lost while traveling through the grid is minimized.

The algorithm tries many different ways to distribute energy for each hour of the day, learning and improving its choices over many rounds (called generations). To make this faster, the project runs these hourly calculations in parallel — meaning at the same time — and also compares it to running them serially.
At the end, it shows:

•	Which hours of the day had the best and worst results in terms of cost and efficiency.

•	Graphs that explain how the algorithm gets better over time.

•	Helpful insights about how energy loss and costs affect electricity distribution in Nepal.

This project helps show how smart computer methods can help Nepal’s power system become more efficient and save money while meeting the country’s electricity needs.
